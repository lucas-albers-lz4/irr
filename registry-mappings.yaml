# IRR Configuration File
# 
# This file contains registry mappings for redirecting container images
# from public registries to your private registry. Update the target values
# to match your registry configuration.
#
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Update the 'target' fields with your actual registry paths
# 2. Use with 'irr override' command to generate image overrides
# 3. Validate generated overrides with 'irr validate'
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - This file uses the standard structured format which includes version, registries, 
#   and compatibility sections for enhanced functionality
# - The 'override' and 'validate' commands can run without this config, 
#   but image redirection correctness depends on your configuration
# - When using Harbor as a pull-through cache, ensure your target paths
#   match your Harbor project configuration
# - You can set or update mappings using 'irr config --source <reg> --target <path>'
# - This file was auto-generated from detected registries in your chart
