# Test Coverage Results for Phase 2.2

## pkg/chart Package
**Before:** 52.3%  
**After:** 68.7%

## Infrastructure Improvements
1. Created centralized test fixtures directory at `pkg/testutil/fixtures/`
   - Organized by package: `chart/`, `rules/`, `override/`, `analysis/`, `image/`
   - Added comprehensive documentation in README.md
   - Created fixtures for each core package with representative test data

2. Implemented log output capture utility in `pkg/testutil/log_capture.go`
   - Added helper for redirecting and capturing log output during tests
   - Provided utility functions for verifying log contents

3. Added CI configuration for test coverage
   - Created GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`
   - Added Codecov configuration in `codecov.yml`
   - Set minimum thresholds for core packages (50%)

## pkg/chart Coverage Improvements
1. Added tests for `OverridesToYAML` function
   - Tested various data structures (simple, nested, arrays)
   - Tested edge cases (empty maps)
   - Verified correct YAML generation

2. Added tests for rules integration
   - Created mocks for rules registry interactions
   - Tested enabling/disabling rules functionality
   - Tested type assertion handling for rules registry

3. Added tests for `validateHelmTemplateInternal` function
   - Tested valid template cases
   - Tested invalid template detection
   - Tested error handling for invalid overrides
   - Tested empty inputs

## Test Fixtures Created
1. **Chart fixtures** - Basic chart structure for testing chart loading and validation
2. **Rules fixtures** - Provider detection patterns for Bitnami charts with different confidence levels
3. **Override fixtures** - Test scenarios for merging different types of override maps
4. **Analysis fixtures** - Test cases for merging analysis results from different charts
5. **Image fixtures** - Comprehensive set of valid and invalid image references

## Remaining Packages
The infrastructure and fixtures created as part of this work will aid in implementing tests for the remaining core packages:
- pkg/override
- pkg/rules
- pkg/analysis
- pkg/image

These fixtures can be reused for consistent and thorough testing across all packages.
