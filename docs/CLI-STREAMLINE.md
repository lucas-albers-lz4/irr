#Flag Consistency Table
Common flags: --chart-path, --namespace, --output-file, --release-name, --debug, --log-level
Unique/less consistent:
--source-registries (inspect/override, but required in override, optional in inspect)
not required in inspect because not required to inspect images in that context

--target-registry (override only)
we have to have this flag because the override command is used to override the target registry
--values (validate only)
--strict (override/validate, but not inspect)
--output-format (inspect only)
I don't think this is used, please confirm.
The main use case is output a yaml file, internally we might process yaml or json, but I don't see use case for this flag in the CLI

--set (validate only)
--dry-run, --strategy, --registry-file, --disable-rules, --threshold (override only)

--strategy is used in override to specify the strategy to use for the override 
Not sure what strategies are available, please confirm.

--debug-template (validate only)
I don't think this is used, please confirm.

--threshold is used in override to specify the threshold to use for the override, not sure what threshold is, please confirm or provide more details
I think this defaults the purpose of making a complete functional change it would seem difficult for the user to even know how the threshold is used or applies to a correct state.
The criteria for a complete functional change is not well defined.
The success state is does the generated override pass validation, if so, what is the purpose of the threshold?

--exclude-pattern, --include-pattern, --known-image-paths (inspect/override, not validate)

--known-image-paths is used in override to specify the paths to the images to be overridden, not sure what paths are, please confirm or provide more details
Not sure the use case of this flag, perhaps it is used to specify the paths to the images to be overridden, but it is not clear what paths are, please confirm or provide more details


#Defaults and Optionality
--chart-path and --release-name are sometimes both present, sometimes one is required, sometimes optional. This can be confusing.
--namespace is present everywhere, but sometimes required, sometimes not.
--source-registries is required in override, optional in inspect, not present in validate.
--output-file is always present, but default behavior (stdout vs file) varies.
Some flags have sensible defaults (--output-format, --kube-version), others do not.

#Redundancy/Complexity
Some flags are only relevant in certain modes (e.g., --release-name for plugin mode).
Some flags could be merged or defaulted (e.g., always allow --chart-path or --release-name, and auto-detect if not provided).
Too many flags in override; could be simplified by better defaults and auto-detection.       

#Mode-Specific Presentation
In plugin mode, --release-name is more relevant;in standalone, --chart-path is primary.
Integration test mode could default or hide flags not relevant for automation.
Presenting all flags in all modes increases cognitive load; should tailor flag set to context.

#Recommendations
Unify --chart-path and --release-name logic: always allow both, auto-detect if one is missing, and clearly document precedence.
Make --namespace always optional, default to "default" if not provided.
Make --source-registries optional in override, with a sensible default (all detected registries).
Use consistent flag names and behavior for output (--output-file always means file, default is stdout).
Hide or default irrelevant flags in plugin/integration modes.
Reduce override command flag count by defaulting or auto-detecting where possible.
Document all defaults and required/optional status clearly in help output.

#Conclusion:
Current flag usage is mostly consistent, but there are areas for simplification and improved defaults. 
Tailoring flag presentation to mode and unifying required/optional logic will make the CLI easier and more predictable for users

Suggestions for each flag:
--output-format : 
Recommendation:
Remove this flag from the CLI. Internally, always output YAML.

--strategy
Recommendation:
The only documented strategy is prefix-source-registry.
Hide the flag if until we add more strategies.

--debug-template
Remove as we don't use it anywhere

--threshold
Recommendation:
The only true success is 100% so a user is expected to exclude or adjust to reach 100% success
Remove as we don't use it anywhere

--known-image-paths
Recommendation:
Remove

--chart-path and --release-name
Your note: Sometimes both present, sometimes one required.
Recommendation:
Always allow both, auto-detect if only one is provided, and document precedence.
In plugin mode, default to --release-name; in standalone, default to --chart-path.

--namespace
Your note: Sometimes required, sometimes not.
Recommendation:
Always optional, default to default.
