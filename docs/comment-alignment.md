Phase 13: Code Documentation Review and Alignment
Goal: Ensure all Go code documentation (godoc, comments) accurately reflects current functionality, removing or correcting outdated information.

Process: Review files package by package or by logical area. For each checklist item (which may cover one or two files, e.g., foo.go and foo_test.go):

Read code and documentation.
Compare documentation to functionality.
Identify and correct/remove discrepancies.
After completing the review for an item, run make lint and make test-quiet to ensure no issues were introduced.
Process them in the most efficient order you decide.
